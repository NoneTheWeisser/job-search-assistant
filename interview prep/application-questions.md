# Scheels Application Questions

## Provide an example of a time in which you have put others' needs before your own.

I remember a time in my last role when we were on deadline for a special section and one of my employees had something urgent come up with their family. They needed to leave to be with them. My manager and I always believed family comes first, but we also believed we were a team. So I took on their workload and stayed late. We redistributed some of my responsibilities so I could focus on meeting the deadline. We got everything out on time, and our employee was able to be with their family when it mattered most. To me, the real win was that we had built a culture where people felt safe asking for that, and where the team would step up to make it happen.

## How would you describe the pace at which you work? (Provide specific examples)

I would say I work at a steady pace that is driven by deadlines. I spent over 12 years in a design environment where almost everything had a fixed delivery date. That taught me to plan ahead, manage my time, and adjust quickly when things changed. More recently in my software development training, we built and deployed full stack applications in four week project sprints. I learned to balance feature work, debugging, and iteration while still hitting the milestones. So I am used to a fast pace, but I prefer to keep it steady rather than rushing. I would rather work efficiently and keep the quality up than sprint and burn out.

## What are you passionate about and why?

I am passionate about solving problems in a way that makes things run smoother for people. I like breaking big, messy problems into clear steps, spotting where things get stuck, and designing solutions that actually make work easier. That mindset comes from my design background, where I spent years coordinating teams, managing deadlines, and seeing how small workflow changes could affect the whole project. Now in software development, I bring that same focus to clarity, usability, and building things that hold up over time.
